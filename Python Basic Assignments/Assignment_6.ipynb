    "###### Q1. What are keywords in python? Using the keyword library, print all the python keywords.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans).   Keywords are reserved words that have a special meaning and cannot be used as identifiers (variable names, function names, etc.). These keywords define the syntax and structure of the language."

    "###### Q2. What are the rules to create variables in python?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans).  Variable names can contain letters (a-z, A-Z), digits (0-9), and underscores (_).\n",
    "They cannot start with a digit and are case-sensitive.\n",
    "Avoid using Python keywords as variable names (e.g., if, else, while).\n",
    "Variable names cannot contain spaces or special characters (except underscore).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Q3. What are the standards and conventions followed for the nomenclature of variables in python to improve code readability and maintainability?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans).  Snake Case: Use lowercase letters and underscores to separate words (e.g., my_variable).\n",
    "Descriptive Names: Choose meaningful and descriptive names for variables to convey their purpose.\n",
    "Avoid Single Underscores: Avoid using a single underscore (_) as a variable name, as it is often reserved for specific contexts.\n",
    "Constants: For constants, use all uppercase letters with underscores (e.g., MAX_VALUE).\n",
    "Private Variables: Prefix variables intended for internal use within a class or module with a single underscore (e.g., _internal_variable).\n",
    "Double Underscores for Name Mangling: Use double underscores for name mangling in classes (e.g., __mangled_variable).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Q4.   What will happen if a keyword is used as a variable name?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans). Using a Python keyword as a variable name will result in a SyntaxError since keywords are reserved. For example, attempting to assign a value to a variable named if or while will raise an error. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Q5.   For what purpose def keyword is used?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans).  The def keyword in Python is used to define a function. When you use def followed by a function name and a block of code, you are creating a function definition. This allows you to encapsulate a sequence of statements into a reusable and modular unit.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Q6.   What is the operation of this special character ‘\\’?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans).  The backslash (\\) is a special character in Python. It is used as an escape character, indicating that the character following it has a special meaning.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Q7.   Give an example of the following conditions:\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans).  (i) Homogeneous list:- A list containing elements of the same data type.\n",
    "\n",
    "           homogeneous_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",

    "\n",
    "   (iii) Homogeneous tuple:-  A tuple containing elements of the same data type.\n",

    "###### Q8.   Explain the mutable and immutable data types with proper explanation & examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans).  Mutable data types in Python, such as lists and dictionaries, allow modifications to their values after creation. For example, you can alter a list's elements or add/remove items from a dictionary.\n",
    "When we modify a mutable object, you are working with the same object in memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Example            mutable_list = [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "              mutable_list[0] = 99             # Modifying the list\n",
    "              \n",
    " On the other hand, immutable data types, like tuples and strings, cannot be changed once instantiated. Any operation that appears to modify them actually creates a new object.When we perform an operation that seems to modify an immutable object, it actually creates a new object.\n",
    " \n",
    " Example              immutable_tuple = (1, 2, 3)\n",
